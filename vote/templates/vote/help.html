            (If you are
            an election manager and want to have a manual on the management backend, visit
            <a href="{% url 'management:help' %}">the management help page</a>). The second part in form of an FAQ will
            answer questions on how the voting mechanism works and why you should prefer this tool instead of let's say
            doodle.

          <h2>Manual for the Vote Frontend</h2>
          <h3>Ways to Get Invited to an Election</h3>
          <p>There are three different ways to get invited to an election</p>
          <ul class="just">
            <li>Via E-Mail: You have to tell our election manager (the one who is hosting the election
              e.g. your house representative) your email address. Our system will then send you an invitation
              via email which contains a participation link. Upon opening that link you will directly be forwarded
              to the voting interface. If you are not able to open the link then you can also enter the code in the
              email into the text filed on <a href="{% url 'vote:index' %}">the voting website</a></li>
            <li>
              Via a personal letter: Your election manager will choose this open when he or she is too lazy to gather
              all
              email addresses and has too much money to spend on printing stuff.
              The letter should be handed to you in paper form. It contains a QR code which
              forwards you directly to the the voting interface. Alternatively, you can also open
              <a href="{% url 'vote:index' %}">the voting website</a> and enter the code which is stated as "Access
              token"
              into input field.
            </li>
            <li>
              Private access token: Last but not least, the election manager can also just download the access token and
              spread them via a medium of hers or his choice. In that case you have to enter the token manually on
              <a href="{% url 'vote:index' %}">the voting website</a>.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Election Overview Page</h3>
          <p class="just">
            Once you are successfully logged in with your unique token you should see an overview page of all elections
            categorized in "Open Elections", "Upcoming Elections", "Published Results" and "Closed Elections". Elections
            are part of an election session e.g. some a general assembly of some association.
            All elections in your session will be displayed in this overview page. Note, that
            the election manager can at any time add new or delete old elections. An example screenshot is shown in the
            following figure. Note that meeting links will be displayed in the header if the election manager enters
            them.
          </p>

            <img src="{% static 'img/help_page/overview_page.png' %}" alt="Example" class="pic">
          </figure>
          <p class="just">
            Open elections will have a blue button which forwards you to the election page. Page updates like the
            activation
            of an election should be done automatically, however, you can also just refresh the page in the browser.
          </p>
          <h4>Election Results</h4>
          <p class="just">
            When an election is over and the results are published the voting outcome will be shown in the overview page
            under the section "Published Results".
            Note that the election manager first needs to actively publish the results once the election is over.
          </p>

          </figure>

          <h4>Apply as Candidate</h4>
          <p class="just">If the election is configured accordingly it might be possible to apply as a candidate. If so
            a black button
            will appear on the right side of the card before the election starts (You can check the election period in
            the upper part of the card when configured by the manager). Furthermore, you can see all applicants with
            their
            name, a photo and a short description why they want to be elected.
            Check the next section to find out how to apply at an election and set those attributes for yourself.
          </p>

          </figure>

          <h3>Apply Page</h3>
          <p class="just">Once you clicked on the "Apply" button you will see the following page.</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="{% static 'img/help_page/apply_page_numbered.png' %}" alt="Example" class="pic">
          </figure>
          <ol class="just">
            <li>Display name: The name that is displayed in the overview page along with the other candidate's names.
              This must be provided to identify you.
            </li>
            <li>Email: You contact email, so that the election manager can contact you once you have been elected. In
              case of the Houseadmin elections from StuStaNet we will use this email to put you onto an admin mail list.
              Note that this email can be different from the one you received for the invitation link.
            </li>
            <li>Description: You can write a little description about why you want to apply for the position. However,
              this is optional.
            </li>
            <li>Choose File: You can, if you want, upload a profile picture.</li>
            <li>The submit button concludes your application. However, you can at any time until the election start
              edit your application from the election overview.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p class="just">If you choose to add a description and picture they will be displayed in the election
            overview.
            You can always edit or delete your application in the election overview page once submitted.</p>

          <h3>Vote Page</h3>
          <figure>
            <img src="{% static 'img/help_page/vote_page_bernd.png' %}" alt="Example" class="pic">
          </figure>

          <p class="just"> Once the election period started you can click on the <strong>Vote Now!</strong> button to
            enter the vote page. An example election is shown above. You can select all applicants that you want
            to give a <em>Yes</em> vote to. The admin might have limited the number of <em>Yes</em> votes you are
            allowed to cast. <em>No</em> means that you are explicitly voting against the candidate. <em>Abstention</em>
            means that you are not intended to participate in the votes for that candidate. Thus, an abstention vote
            will not be counted for any side. Donâ€™t forget to click the <strong>Submit</strong> button once you are done
            to finalize casting your vote.

          <h2>FAQ</h2>

          <h3>How can I create a new election?</h3>
          <p class="just">
            You need to create a management account. For further details see the
            <a href="{% url 'vote:index' %}">the management help page</a>.
          </p>
          <h3>Why is there a need for such a tool?</h3>
          <p class="just">
            During the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic there was a big need for an online voting tool for having fair elections
            in the Studentenstadt Freimann (there are many events where elections are necessary).
            Because other online voting tools seem insescure (see below), the StuStaNet decided to implement its own
            system.<br>
            Usually, during a session (say a general assembly of a student dormitory) there will be votes on multiple
            things. Therefore
            multiple votes are brought together into a session. This has the big advantage that the voters stay the same
            and only one email per voter per session is necessary.<br>
            The original version was created just for the purpose of the StuStaNet house admin elections and has then
            been adapted to also work for general elections and also support sessions.
          </p>


          <h3>Why not just use Doodle?</h3>
          <p class="just">The problem with doodle and most polling platforms is that they often have no mechanism build
            in to prevent a person from voting again because users are not authenticated. This also means that they
            do not check whether a user is even allowed to vote. Some platforms have a configuration which allows
            only one vote per IP address. This, however, is no solution if several users hide behind the same NAT.<br>
            Then there are also real voting platforms that promise real authenticity and anonymity. However, they
            are often foreign companies that store your data probably not in your country and you have to trust them on
            their technology as well as the deletion process once the election is over. </p>


          <h3>What is Wahlfang, how can I contribute?</h3>
          <p class="just">Wahlfang is the software behind {% url 'vote:index' %}. It is open source with the source code
            available on
            <a href="https://github.com/stustanet/wahlfang">github</a>. It was developed and is currently maintained
            by the <a href="https://stustanet.de">StuStaNet e.V.</a> a student association which committed itself to
            host and maintain the network infrastructure of the largest student dormitory in munich, the
            <a href="https://www.stusta.de">StuSta</a>. If you live in the StuSta and are wanting to actively
            participate
            in our society check our website linked above.
            <br>If you are interested to contribute to this project see the questions below.
            <br>The name Wahlfang itself is pun of the german words Wahl, Fang and Walfang. Wahl means Election and
            Walfang means hunting wahles, thus the election the Wahl (instead of the wahle) is in the net referring to
            the
            internet.
          </p>
