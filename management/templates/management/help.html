          <h2>Sessions and Elections</h2>
          <p>Our system is structured into voting sessions which have several elections and the same set of voters. A
            common case for this setup is given during organizational meetings like Heimr√§te where members decide about
            new offices or spendings of the organization. Voters are usually invited to sessions via email but can
            also be invited via mail with a QR-code or with a token.</p>

          <h3>Session</h3>
          <p>Thus, the first thing is to create a new Session. The session can have a name, a starting date and a
            meeting
            URL. The starting date and meeting URL will be display in the invitation. Furthermore, the meeting URL will
            be displayed for the voters in the election view. The session setting can also be changed later on.</p>
          <h3>Election</h3>
          <p>After a session has been created one can start adding elections. However, if they are not known beforehand
            it possible to add
            a new election at any point. An election can have a name a start time an end time and a maximal number of
            yes votes. Start and end time are both optional.
            An election can be started/stopped at any time before the actual given times. If no end time is given the
            default election length is 5 minutes. The maximal number of yes votes is also optional. If no number is
            given
            the participants can vote yes for every option/candidate.</p>
          <p>Once an election is created, one can click on the election to add options/applicants for the election. This
            view also allows to start and stop the election. When the election is over due to the time limit or has been
            stopped manually the results can be published to the voters.</p>
          <h3>Voters</h3>
          <p>One can add voters to the election on the session's view. There are three ways to add voters:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Via E-Mail invitation: Gather all emails and paste them into the "Add Voters" page one by one</li>
            <li>Via CSV: Similar to email but can be used to add a lot more participants. This method also allows to
              specify the voters name for a personal invitation
            </li>
            <li>Via Token: Just add the number of voters where you do not have an email and click "Download Tokens" on
              the hamburger menu. This will create a pdf file that you can print out or send the code via messenger.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>Furthermore, it is possible to create a spectator link for all people who are not allowed to cast a vote
            themselves but still want to observe the election's outcome. To create a public link to a side that just
            displays the published results (voters can also only see the results once they are published) go to the
            upper hamburger menu in the session's view and click "Public Spectator Link".
            You can now create a link (to which you can also remove the access later on) and distribute it.</p>

          <h2>Advanced Features</h2>
          <p>The creation pages of sessions and elections have a drop down menu for advanced options which will be
            explained in this section</p>
          <h3>Sessions</h3>
          <p>In the advanced options of the creation of a session (and also in the edit page) it is possible to
            customize the invite text which is sent to the voters. The table shows variables which can be used like the
            meeting url. Variables shall be used in python format string snytax in the text e.g. {variable_name}. Once
            finished a test email can be send to your email address to check if
            all variables render correctly.</p>
          <h3>Elections</h3>
          <p>When creating an election you can also specify if abstention votes should be disabled. Furthermore, you can
            allow voters to apply themselves. In this way they dont need to be added maually which is useful for
            elections where applicants can apply during the meeting. Furthermore, it is also possible to send a reminder
            email when the election starts. This, however, is only really
            useful when the election starts several days after the invitation e.g. because people are welcomed to apply
            for the election. As for sessions it is again possible to customize this remind email with the same syntax
            explained above.</p>
